# WX-Dashboard-Challenge-6

## Purpose
This is a learning project for CWRU's coding bootcamp.  The project was designed to utilize the Open Weather API to fetch weather data after a user inputs which city they would like to get the weather for.  It shows current weather and a 5 day outlook.  City names are stored into local storage and displayed after the page refreshes.  The city names should act as buttons to display the weather information for the city again.
